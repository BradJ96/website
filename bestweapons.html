    <p>The joys of opening a care package and finding the absolute beast of a weapon the almighty kraber.
    <br>
    It makes the sound of a demon and Hits like a train. Hitting a 290 headshot has never been more satisfying.

        <h2>2.Wingman</h2>

    <div class="content">
        <p>The pistol everyone loves and If you know also the right hand of the god himself <a href="https://liquipedia.net/apexlegends/Aceu#:~:text=Brandon%20%22aceu%22%20Winn%20(born,fellow%20Apex%20Legends%20player%2C%20iiTzTimmy." target="_blank">Aceu</a>.
            <br>
           The season 1 veterans will tell you everything this gun was, 75% hp of an enemy in one bullet.
           <br>
           Who wouldn't love that RIGHT?

    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Shotguns can be your best friend or worse enemy but no shotgun compares to the peacekeeper<br>
            when it comes to anxiety of hitting a 9 pump.<br>
            Although this weapon has inconsistencies the feeling of hitting a 110 pump never felt so good.

        <h2>4.Flatline</h2>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The flatline is in the god tier of assault rifles, rolling through enemies like they don't exist.<br>
            A ranked players best buddy, 20/25/28/30 bullets per mag is enough to wipe a squad with just a single clip !!!
        </p>

        <p>
            This gun has to be the biggest meme in FPS history, A bolt action sniper without the<br>
            ability to down someone with 1 bullet which is unknown across every FPS.<br>
            Although it's has negatives do not get mistaken, this sniper to be one of the most fun weapons to use.
