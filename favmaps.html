            Over the 3 year life span of Apex Legends the map designers have produced some great<br>
            maps with incredible graphics and some pretty cool features<br>
            Here are the order of ranking Plum007tomato rates these maps:<br>

                The map that stole everyones heart, From your average player<br>
                to absolute sweat apex pred, people from all over come together,<br>
                to experience the joys of this map. Challenging themselves by<br>
                attempting to take on the entire lobby at Capitol or as the new<br>
                players call it fragment. "Pfft"

        <p>
            The map where it all started, where thousands of Apex predators were born,<br>
            That's right Kings Canyon. No better feeling than coming out of the dropship<br>
            heading for skull town and seeing 90% of the players behind you then<br>
            landing on a 3 bullet mozambique that couldn't even kill an 100hp target.<br>
            Ah the good old days.

        <p>Alot of Questions came with this map like "Why is Worlds edge gone",
        "We don't need a new map" <br>but here comes olympus. Nice and bright colours,
        make sure you don't have<br> epilepsy because the visuals on this map would not help.
        Although<br> the brightness of this map, the blessing of estate will always be a great introduction.

            Dear Respawn never create a map like this monstrosity, a few decent designs<br>
            to the map but adding mountains that need you to run a marathon the get around them?!?!?<br>
            Prowlers aka dogs that chase you in middle of a fight with a person great idea? No.<br>
            Gravity cannons are pretty cool but other than that this is easily the worst map of them all.
